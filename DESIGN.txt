 Level 1: Asteroid Waves
 In the first level, Sky will have to eliminate waves of small asteroids
 that are headed towards Earth. These asteroids are small and are
 eliminated with one hit. The goal is to get through the waves without
 letting more than three asteroids get past Sky's ship.
 
 Level 2: Boss Asteroid
 In the second level, the source of all the asteroids is revealed. It turns
out the source is a giant asteroid with a face on it. This asteroid is much
bigger and will take more than a few hits to kill. The asteroid also has
a mind of its own and moves side to side as it moves towards Earth. Destroy
the boss before it get's past Sky's ship or it is game over
