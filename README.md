# README.MD

	I started this project on September 1 and completed it on
	September 11 and probably worked on it for close to 24 hours 
	on it. Since I was the only one working on it, I was in charge
	of coming up with the idea and implementing it myself. 
    
    For resources, I primarily used the JavaFX docs. I looked up classes
    such as VBox, Text, Scene, Group and some others. I also used a
    website on Professor Duval's website to help me with commenting 
    my code. Finally I used some of Professors Duval's sample code
    that he gave in class that had the Duke. I used that primarily 
    for my main class and kept a few parts for my Game class.

	In order to start my project, you need to run the main class. 
	This will initialize the game class which brings up the load
	screen. There are no command line arguments to start the game,
	you just have to run it and then start playing. There is an image
	folder that my program has that is necessary to load the
	ImageViews for the Sprites in the game. To my knowledge, there are
	no bugs with the game. However, my game does not adjust to resizing
	so the game will only occur on the initial size of the screen. 
	
Cheat Codes (after you hit enter and start the game)
* S- Skips the first level and goes straight to the boss level
* W- Automatically beat the game and go straight to the game over screen
* A- Makes all hits on the boss direct hits (5x damage)

    Overall I thought the assignment was a good introduction to
    JavaFx. I thought it was a good way to learn the material. A few
    suggestions would be like a list of do's and dont's before we
    start. I found that I spent a lot of time thinking about whether
    my design was good or not so maybe just like a list of things to
    avoid would be helpful. Also, listing a couple of helpful JavaFx
    classes would save a lot of time early on.
